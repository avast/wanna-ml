# WANNA project

WANNA project settings set some generic information about your project. 

`wanna_project` section of the yaml config consists of the following inputs:

- `name` - the name of the wanna project should be unique, this name will be used in the docker service 
  for naming docker images and in labeling GCP resources. Hence it can be used also for budget monitoring.
- `version` - Currently used only in labeling GCP resources, we expect to introduce new API versions 
  and then this parameter will gain more importance. 
- `authors` - List of email addresses, currently used only in GCP resource labeling but soon also in monitoring.

### Example

```
wanna_project:
  name: wanna-julia-notebooks
  version: 1
  authors: [harry.potter@avast.com, ronald.weasley@avast.com]
```
