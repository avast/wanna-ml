# WANNA Managed notebook
It offers a simple way of deploying Jupyter Notebooks on GCP, with minimum environment
set up, automatic mount of all GCS buckets in the project, connection do Dataproc clusters and more.

### Obligatory fields
- `name`- Custom name for this instance
- `owner` - Currently only the owner will be able to access the notebook

### Dataproc clusters and metastore
If you want to run Spark jobs on a Dataproc cluster and also have a Hive Metastore service available
as your default Spark SQL engine:

- Create a Dataproc Metastore in your GCP project & region in the Google Cloud UI
- Create a Dataproc cluster connected to this metastore, with a subnet specified. e.g.:
```
gcloud dataproc clusters create cluster-test --enable-component-gateway --region europe-west1 --subnet cloud-lab --zone europe-west1-b --single-node --optional-components JUPYTER --dataproc-metastore projects/cloud-lab-304213/locations/europe-west1/services/jacek-test
```
- Run your managed notebook. As kernel use Pyspark on the remote Dataproc cluster that you have just created
- Test your spark Session for access. This example creates a database in your metastore:
```
spark = SparkSession \
    .builder \
    .appName("MetastoreTest") \
    .getOrCreate()

query = """CREATE DATABASE testdb"""
spark.sql(query)
```    

### Tensorboard integration
`tb-gcp-uploader` is needed to upload the logs to the tensorboard instance. A detailed
tutorial on this tool can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/experiments/tensorboard-overview).

If you set the `tensorboard_ref` in the WANNA yaml config, we will export the tensorboard resource name
as `AIP_TENSORBOARD_LOG_DIR`.

### Additional notebook parameters
Apart from the above, we offer additional parameters for you:

- `machine_type` - GCP Compute Engine machine type 
- `tags` - GCP Compute Engine tags to add to the runtime
- `labels`- Custom labels to apply to this instance
- `metadata`- Custom metadata to apply to this instance
- `gpu`- The hardware GPU accelerator used on this instance. 
- `data_disk` - Data disk configuration to attach to this instance.
- `subnet`- Subnetwork of a given network
- `kernels` - Custom kernels given as links to container registry
- `idle_shutdown` - True or false
- `idle_shutdown_timeout` - Time in minutes, between 10 and 1440
